# Write a method that returns true if the string passed as an argument is a palindrome, false otherwise. A palindrome reads the same forward and backward. For this exercise, case matters as does punctuation and spaces.

def palindrome?(input)
  input == input.reverse
end 

p palindrome?('madam') == true
p palindrome?('Madam') == false          # (case matters)
p palindrome?("madam i'm adam") == false # (all characters matter)
p palindrome?('356653') == true
p palindrome?(['1', 'two', '3']) == false
p palindrome?(['1', 'two', '1']) == true


# Further Exploration
# Write a method that determines whether an array is palindromic; that is, the element values appear in the same sequence both forwards and backwards in the array. Now write a method that determines whether an array or a string is palindromic; that is, write a method that can take either an array or a string argument, and determines whether that argument is a palindrome. You may not use an if, unless, or case statement or modifier.
