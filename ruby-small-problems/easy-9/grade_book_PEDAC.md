P

- Write a method that determines the mean (averae) of the three scores passed to it, and returns the letter value associated with that grade.
- Tested values are all between 0 and 100. There is no need to check for negative values or values greater than 100

E

- ```ruby
  get_grade(95, 90, 93) == "A"
  get_grade(50, 50, 95) == "D"
  ```

D

- Input: Three integers
- Output: String of letter grade
- case statement

A

- calculate mean of the integers given
- case statement to determine which letter grade to output
- return letter grade
